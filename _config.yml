  We are a team working on starting a Internet of Things data network for Dunedin, in the south of New Zealand. LoraWANâ„¢, the technology that allows for things to talk to the internet without 3G or WiFi is perfect for the internet of things. So no WiFi codes and no mobile subscriptions. It features low battery usage, long range and low bandwidth.
