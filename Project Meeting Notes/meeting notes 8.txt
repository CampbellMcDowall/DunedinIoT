Meeting 8:
Apologies: Zoe Sutherland
Meeting with Michael Welzel from Work Control summary: very interested in IoT stuff. Want to put up a gateway at the university. Open yet commercial solution. Freemium services.
	Norwegian tech, with gateway and room sensor (CO2, etc). Closed-sourced backend. Hates Haxiot, use Kerlinks. Back in June/July with more concrete plan. Neville: energy for polytech.
	Setups for uni, internships for students. Approves of multitech gateways.
	
We're in RND/test space. Best to stay there and not compete.
Anything above 868 is useable
915-928 is best.

Do we use our own backend or TTN?
Should we use less gateways tha originally planned?

Package tester: simulate node and gateway sending data to loraserver. Packet forwarder and another thing (thing network wiki, or OP website?).

Any benefit getting local frequency interference from Steven Turnbull?

Getting Dragino shields and GPS_Hat ($36 for full node with full LoRa standard specs)
