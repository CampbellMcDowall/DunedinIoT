Meeting notes 13 (29/05/17)

Apologies: Brendan + Zoe (busy with sysadmin work). Campbell assisting Brendan.

Restart meeting at 1.30

Time to organize an official plan! We have 3 weeks left and we need a solution in place NOW

Showcase: do we want to create something small to present how IoT and our project works?

TTN vs Loraserver:
TTN has no web interface but good CLI. Neither have a database for rx node data (as far as we can tell).
Benefit to using TTN private backend?

Everyone is very busy! Assignments and stuff.
