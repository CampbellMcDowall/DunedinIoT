Brendan: gateway working on the pi, talking to loriot. Quite smart program? Need to start uploading data. Once it's working, all it requires
is a change in settings. Cheap gateways, and nodes if we can find nodes that can send above 915htz.
Haxiot: basic code. Should logically be able to changee frequency, but can't find where. We can still buy $1500 for new gateway, just in case.
Also their nodes are what we want, so buying more of those is a good idea.
Pi is getting OVERPOWERED. Gateway can only be supplied through USB which Pi can't handle.
GitHub permissions working. Jekyl theme chosen. Backing up database working.
Firewall permissions on AWS, port numbers and other things need to be sorted.
Markdown for documentation? Store on GitHub pages? Git branches / forks?
Personal story: summary of what you've learnt over the semester, focus on 4 projects. Upload to github portfolio.
Poster: Due in 3 weeks from now (05/06/17 at the latest). Should be done as a group.
